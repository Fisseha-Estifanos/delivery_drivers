## Introduction

> Our client for this week's challenge is [Gokada](https://www.gokada.ng/) - the largest last-mile delivery service in Nigeria. Gokada works are partnered with motorbike owners and drivers to deliver parcels across Lagos, Nigeria. One key issue Gokada has faced as it expands its service is the sub-optimal placement of pilots and clients who want to use Gokada to send their parcels. This has led to a high number of unfulfilled delivery requests.

> Therefore, Gokada is asking 10 Academy trainees, to work on its data to help it understand the primary causes of unfulfilled requests as well as come up with solutions that recommend drivers' locations that increase the fraction of complete orders. Since drivers are paid based on the number of requests they accept, your solution will help Gokada's business grow both in terms of client satisfaction and increased business.

> We will be using causal inference and logistic optimization models to achieve the objective mentioned above.

## Objective

> This objective of this project is very straightforward: use causal inference and logistic optimization to increase the number of fulfilled deliveries, decrease unfulfilled deliveries, increase customer satisfaction and understand the primary cause of unfulfilled requests as well as come up with solutions that recommend drivers' locations that increase the fraction of complete orders.

## Data

> As mentioned above our client for this week is [Gokada](https://www.gokada.ng/). The data was directly obtained from their company which they have been collecting over their years of delivering parcels to customers and is not shared to the public or third parties.

> There were two data sets that were provided. The first dataset contains information regarding the delivery trip and its attributes while the second contains information related to the drivers, the actions they took, and their location.

## Requirements

> Pip

> Python 3.5 or above
